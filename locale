locale:

wiki: In computing, a locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and any special variant preferences 
that the user wants to see in their user interface. 
Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language identifier and a region identifier.

java: Locales identify a specific language and geographic region. 

In Java:
A java.util.Locale is a lightweight object that contains only a few important members:

A language code
An optional country or region code
An optional variant code

When writing or talking about locales, you can use a text abbreviation for a convenient representation. 
This notation separates each component of a locale with an underscore character:

<language code>[_<country code>[_<variant code>]]
