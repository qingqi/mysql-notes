A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. 
A collation is a set of rules for comparing characters in a character set.

Suppose we have an alphabet with four letters: 'A', 'B', 'a', 'b'. 
We give each letter a number: 'A' = 0, 'B' = 1, 'a' = 2, 'b' = 3.
The letter 'A' is a symbol, the number 0 is encoding of 'A'.
The combination of all four letters and their encoding is a character set.

MySQL do a lot of things for you:
Store strings using a variety of character sets.
Compare strings using a variety of collations.
Mix strings with different character sets or collations in the same server, database, or even the same table.
enable specification of character set and collation at any level.
