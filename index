Index is implemented in the storage engine layer, not in the server layer. So that indexing works differently in each engine, even for the same type of index.

B-Tree index (MyISAM, InnoDB)
values are stored in order
each leaf page is the same distance from the root
Query: searching for ranges of data, key prefix, full key value ( index on multiple columns, order matters)

Index-only query?


Hash index
